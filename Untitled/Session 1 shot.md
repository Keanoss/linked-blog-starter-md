You all are slugblasters, a group of teenage dirtbags doing the oh-so-beloved sport of extra-dimensional skateboarding and vandalism. 

You all are nobodies, however, you have a plan. [ORGANIZATION] has offered a sponsorship to anybody who tags the sealed inner chambers of a ruins in the Golden Jungle, and posts proof of it online.

## The Place

## 1. The Entrance
A rival crew followed you here, and wants that sponsorship. 

## 2. The Puzzle
- Opposite of the first room.
	- Meant to engage roleplay and story.
- Swappable with room 1. (Can explain why dungeon hasn't been looted, and then guardian can be the guard)
- Use this room to foreshadow stuff.
	- Screaming mass puzzle?

## 3. The Setback
A math panther chases these assholes, and there are also big ass pits filled with slugs

## 4. The Climax
The chamber is opened, and the inner sanctum is a brilliant rotunda. On the walls are great murals detailing the rise and fall of some civilization. Perfect tagging grounds.
